1. Vecna AI Assistant
Vecna is a voice-activated desktop assistant powered by Google's Gemini AI. It automates system tasks like opening applications, controlling volume, playing music on YouTube, and checking the weather using natural language commands. The project features a custom Tkinter GUI for real-time status updates and utilizes secure API integration for intelligent, context-aware responses.

2. BMI Calculator
This is a comprehensive health tracking application built with Python and Tkinter. It calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) with instant visual feedback and color-coded categories. Key features include a local SQLite database for saving user history, statistical trend analysis, and the ability to export health records to CSV format.

3. Weather App
A sleek, dark-themed desktop weather dashboard that provides real-time conditions and forecasts for any global location. It integrates with WeatherAPI.com to fetch live data, auto-detects user location via IP, and visualizes hourly temperature trends using Matplotlib charts, all within a responsive, multi-threaded GUI.

4. SecurePass Generator
SecurePass is a cryptographic password generator designed for high security. Built using Python's secrets module, it creates unpredictable passwords with customizable length and complexity options. It includes features for excluding ambiguous characters and a one-click copy-to-clipboard function, ensuring secure and user-friendly password management.

Note: All these projects were developed by me during my internship at Oasis Infobyte, demonstrating my proficiency in Python development, GUI design, API integration, and automation
